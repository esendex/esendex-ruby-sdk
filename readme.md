# Esendex

Ruby Gem for interacting with the Esendex API

This is in very early stages of development but supports sending one or multiple messages using your account details

## Usage

### Setting up

From the command line

    gem install esendex

or in your project's Gemfile.

    gem 'esendex'

Before sending messages you need to configure the gem with your credentials. In a Rails app this would typically go into a file called `esendex.rb` in the *config/initializers*.

```ruby
Esendex.configure do |config|
  config.username = "<username>"
  config.password = "<password>"
  config.account_reference = "<account_reference>"
end
```

You can omit account reference and specify it when you instantiate an account object if you're using multiple accounts.

You can also specify these using the environment variables `ESENDEX_USERNAME`, `ESENDEX_PASSWORD` and `ESENDEX_ACCOUNT`.

### Sending Messages

First instantiate an Account with the reference. You can omit the reference if you've already configured one to use in the *Esendex.configure* step.
Then, call the send method on the account object with a hash describing the message. The return value is a *batch_id* you can use to obtain the status of the messages you have sent.

```ruby
account = Account.new
batch_id = account.send_message( to: "07777111222", body: "Saying hello to the world with the help of Esendex")
```
You can specify a different account to the default by passing the reference in as an initialization argument

```ruby
account = Account.new('EX23847')
```

Multiple messages are sent by passing an array of `Messages` to the send_messages method
	
```ruby
batch_id = account.send_messages([Message.new("07777111222", "Hello"), Message.new("07777111333", "Hi")])
```

### Testing Configuration

The Esendex Gem ships with a couple of rake tasks that allow you to simply validate that all is well.

    rake esendex:validate['<username>,'<password>','<account_reference>']

This will confirm that the credentials passed can access the account.

You can also send a message

    rake esendex:send_message["<mobile_number>","<message_body>"]

You will need to set the credentials as enviroment variables which can also be done inline

    rake esendex:send_message["<mobile_number>","<message_body>"] ESENDEX_USERNAME=<username> ESENDEX_PASSWORD=<password> ESENDEX_ACCOUNT=<account_reference>


### Testing

		bundle exec rspec
	
will run specs, ie those in the root of the test folder
